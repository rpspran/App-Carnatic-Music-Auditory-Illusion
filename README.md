Methodology:
I developed an Audio?Visual App using App Designer IDE of MATLAB.  The Codes are outlined in App1_mlapp_code_view (copied from the Code View of the App1.mlapp file). The grahabhedam.m is a functional representation of the core algorithm. The .mat files refer to the database of ragas (musical melodies) used in this project.

The GUI Interface is designed such that when a user selects a particular scale, the algorithm computes the possibilities of derived music scales from the base scale, and displays the generated output in the form of a tabular column and also plays the audio of each of the derived scales. The code is designed for generating the derived scales for three types of Ragas that are covered under three separate Tabs (as outlined in the Tab1.png, Tab2.png and Tab3.png). A detailed algorithmic framework is outlined in Graha Bhedam App Development Project.pdf.


Objective:
To develop an audio-visual demonstration tool using the App Designer IDE of MATLAB for demonstrating the concept of Auditory Illusion in Indian Classical Music. The notion of "Graha Bhedam" is tough to comprehend and this "app" endeavors to improve the understanding of this concept to Indian Classical music listeners, connoisseurs, students and teachers.

I had the great opportunity to have demonstrated this tool to Sangeetha Kalanidhi Sanjay Subramanian and received feedback on taking this forward towards a "Software Development" for "Carnatic Music Universities", for the benefit of students and teachers. The process of developing subsequent versions of this is in process, in consultation with musical archivist Mr. Yessel Narasimhan.
